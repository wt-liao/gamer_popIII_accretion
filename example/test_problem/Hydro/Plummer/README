========================================


Note:
========================================
1. Test the evolution of the Plummer model
   --> Plummer_Collision = 0: test the stability of a single Plummer cloud
                           1: test the collision of two Plummer clouds
2. One can set NCOMP_PASSIVE_USER = 2 for Plummer_Collision == 1
   --> Different clouds will be assigned with different passive scalars
3. Plummer cloud(s) can have both gas and particles
   --> Plummer_GasMFrac: gas mass fraction
