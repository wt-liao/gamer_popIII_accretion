Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY
Disable: PARTICLE, COMOVING, DUAL_ENERGY


Default setup:
========================================
1. Adopt mass density as the refinement criteria
   --> Input__Flag_Rho
2. Maximum refinement level (MAX_LEVEL) = 6


Note:
========================================
1. This test problem will overwrite gas field to store the gravitational potential errors

      [gas momentum x] --> [absolute errors of potential]
      [gas momentum y] --> [relative errors of potential]

   Two output files will be generated:

      "PotError.bin": binary file similar to Data_?????? but with the gas field overwritten
      "PotError.txt": text   file storing the overwritten data along the diagonal

2. Two plot scripts are provided:

      "plot__pot_error_diagonal.gpt" --> plot the text file "PotError.txt" using gnuplot
      "plot__pot_error_slice.py"     --> plot a slice of potential error from "PotError.bin" using yt

3. Currently support 2 density profiles: NFW and Hernquist
   --> Controlled by the parameter "Gra_DensProf"
   --> Note that errors in NFW can be very large since the total mass in NFW diverges and the adopted analytical
       solution assumes zero potential at infinity
       --> Numerical and analytical solutions will differ by a DC term
